This is my first time writing a personal blog. I've written things to the internet anonymously before, but it never felt so personal. The more personal it feels, the more uncomfortable I get. It's almost like it's attached to my identity. What I put out there is what people will think of me.

I think it's true to an extent; other people can only see so much of the iceberg that is a person, so whatever words you say or behaviors you take become your defining traits. I don't think that is what is making me uncomfortable though. I think it's the fact that I will be exposing more and more of that iceberg as I write more. Only now that I am attempting to share more of myself do I realize that there is a lot I am afraid to share. I guess this is what you would call vulnerability, correct?

If it were not for my determination to get this blog released no matter how anxious I feel when thinking about what people will think about my words or the hacked-together simple code this website was built with, and no matter how meaningless it feels to post something to the internet in this day and age where everything is being drowned out by the deluge of other content, this blog would not have been released. I have been working on it for over a month now. It's a very simple single-page application. Coding it in pure Javascript with minimal dependencies was fun and educational. But I don't think the actual idea of _publishing_ it to the world sunk it until my mouse was hovering over the `Make public` button in GitHub.

But here we are. This is the first blog post.

## the purpose of this site

This blog is for me. I wanted a creative outlet for free thought and expression. But I wasn't satisfied with journaling some private for myself. I felt like I needed to get used to outputting to other people and get over that fear of vulnerability. I felt like if I didn't do that, I would feel more alone and isolated.

So this is a thoughts dump page, rather than a blog. Calling it a blog sounds too fancy, too polished. Thoughts dump sounds more appropriate. More comfortable. Whatever it takes to get those thoughts out there.

## ground rules (for myself)

1. Minimal editing. Force yourself not to go back and edit your words as much. Typo fixes are fine but too much editing is counter to the goal. Fight against perfectionism.
2. No AI writing assistance.
3. Write whatever comes to mind as often as you can.

## it's finally done

Now I can go work on another project. Recently I've been into cooking and meal planning, so something along those lines. I will make posts about those updates when they come out.
