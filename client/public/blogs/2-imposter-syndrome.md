I recently finished watching Attack on Titan with my partner. I know, a bit late to the party. I was disappointed to see that they don't have any AoT gachas anymore at the local game center. Really missed the boat on that.

Anyway, there was a lot to think about after the show ended. I dug into the plethora of content on YouTube and Reddit about ending explanations, fan theories, character analyses, etc. But the most relatable thing that has stuck with me the most is the overarching theme of **moving forward in a world full of fear and uncertainty**.

Jean is the most relatable in terms of this. Oh, heads up going forwards:

_MAJOR SPOILERS FOR AOT_

Jean is a normal guy who dreamed about living a comfortable life within the walls, away from the misery and death of the world beyond. His sole motivation to join the military was to accomplish this one goal: to be happy.

But after witnessing the horrors and the real threat of the Titans firsthand, he came to deeply understand how necessary it was to fight back against them. It was necessary, but he was convinced that he wasn't cut out to do it. He was no genius, no superhuman or human with extraordinary power and fearlessness. He was just a guy. A guy who was absolutely _terrified_. Not only of the Titans themselves, but of the huge responsibility and suffering that was guaranteed. He lacked convinction and was constantly questioning himself all throughout the series.

However, it was the words of his friend Marco that set him straight: _It's precisely because he was weak that he was able to relate to his comrades. That relatability, plus his innate ability to access the situation under pressue, was what made him a leader worth listening to._

His weakness and cowardice is actually a _strength_ in his situation. Sure, it makes him falter each time he has to do something difficult or terrifying. It causes a lot of internal conflict and suffering. But it's this very real, very human side of him that ultimately makes him the strong soldier he is in the show. Without it, he wouldn't have empathized with all of those that had fallen. With his supposed "enemy" past the walls that are suffering in a similar way.

Jean chose to embrace his humanity and weakness. This is a huge contrast with Eren, who ends up choosing his selfish desires to destroy the world over being human, essentially.

I related to Jean's struggles a lot. Although I am no where in as perilous a situation as the characters of AoT are, I find myself constantly paralyzed by fear and uncertainty. Honestly, most days I want nothing more than to crawl into bed and hibernate in there for weeks. There's something innately uncomfortable about living life and growing past yourself.

Also like Jean, I realize that I'm an extremely average person. I'm not particularly that smart. I'm not very brave. I hate public speaking and being vulnerable to other people. I don't have any outstanding qualities about myself that make me shine over others. How could someone like that ever achieve anything outstanding, _extraordinary_?

Then I look to the story of the creator of AoT himself: Hajime Isayama. He was just some guy. And he happened to write a global hit that has the ability to traumatize and touch people's hearts. He still is just some guy. He seems to constantly be anxious and filled with self-doubt, even after, actually especially after the series became a huge success. That's just how it is. It's because he's human and will always be human. But despite all of the stress and fear he feels, he keeps moving forward. Because he has something he knows he wants to share.

And that, my friends, is the single most inspiring thing ever. Maybe I will never achieve anything significant in life. Accepting that is difficult. But if there's just one thing I will promise myself to do, it's to keep moving forward as my cowardly self.
