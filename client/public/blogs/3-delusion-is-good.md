I was on the typical mindless YouTube binge when I watched the Veritasium video [_Why Being Delusional is a Superpower_](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I?si=JwjGKwSmV9ATulMY) and it summed up my thoughts pretty perfectly on this. Also thanks to Dr. K's shorts lately which have consistently sneaked into my feed time and time again, educating me on the importance of _delusion_ within people who actually go out and do interesting things.

Overthinkers and ruminators don't really do anything. The impulse, maybe spark or idea to try something is usually always there, given one doesn't have something like severe depression. But why doesn't it go anywhere? Because our minds have already decided it's not worth pursuing because of X and Y. _Why bother following my passion if I know the chances of making any money is slim? Why should I put in so much effort if the world is inherently unfair and I will never be fairly rewarded and recognized? What can one insignificant human do in a world with so many complex issues? Who cares about what I am even doing? In fact, why should I even bother with living like this when it doesn't matter?_ Therein ensues the spiral of existential crisis and pessimism.

I don't think anyone will argue that those are some real struggles that question the meaning of "having a good life" itself. Luck is huge for success, especially the accumulation of it which helps when you're already born in a fairly advantageous position. Of course, I am grateful that I have a roof over my head and have never had to worry about putting food on the table (yet) but of course there will always be someone who rolled better.

Us overthinkers know this so well that we just give up. Resign to the fact that we can't change much about it, be bitter about it maybe and curse out wealthy billionaires on Reddit.

But let's flip the situation on its head. Now we have someone who doesn't overthink. In fact, they might not think much at all. You could even say they are a little dumb.

They have some urge to try to do something. But now there is no chain reaction of rational thought that is stopping them from acting. They don't think about the consequences much. They might not even think about the amount of effort or steps it would take to achieve their goals. They just move towards trying to do the thing. And that by itself is already so incredibly powerful.

I don't know about you, but given a person who finds a hundred completely fair and logical reasons to _not_ do something versus a person who doesn't have a particular reason to do something but does it anyway, I'd say the later is **way** more fascinating. Their decisions might be poorly-thought out, or rather stupid if you think about the context or whatever, but they made the decision to do it. That's called living life.

I don't know why I didn't realize this sooner, but it's totally true. Trying to make the "right choices" in life all of the time and thinking so much actually just hinders any real progress. Because you've already convinced yourself that most roads lead to a dead-end. Heuristically that might be true, but life seems to have some funny outcomes sometimes. Don't knock it until you try it they say. So I'm adopting in my life to be a little more stupid. Don't think, do. At least when I look back on it years from now, I can laugh at my failures and maybe even be proud of the small successes I might have. I would much rather prefer that over the me that regrets not having tried anything.
