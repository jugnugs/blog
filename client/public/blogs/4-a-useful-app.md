I have recently been making the effort to just keep building things. Anything. As long as I have a slim interest in it, that's enough to keep me occupied and feel like I am actually building skills and learning something. Whether that something is _useful_, however, is a different matter.

I do want to make something, at the very least, that is useful to **me**. I live pretty minimally; I don't rely on too many tools and gadgets outside of my calendar app on my phone for scheduling, Notion for planning, Netflix for anime and dramas, LINE/Discord/WhatsApp for staying in touch with people, the native memo app on my iPhone for my grocery list...actually, that's a lot. Such is the life of the modern human in 2025.

But anyway, what I mean to say is that I try to limit the amount of apps and gadgetry I use to the few select ones that actually enhance my life in some way. At least I try. It is debatable how much YouTube enhances my life; I have this internal dilemma every day. But I digress.

Here I want to build something I would actually find valuable and use regularly. This is actually pretty hard to assess. I mean sure, like anyone I have thoughts here and there about how if I had this one thing in this one particular moment that things would be easier or that would be so cool or whatever. But most of those thoughts are situational. So I haven't had many actually actionable ideas.

So here's the criteria for satisfying what I would deem something "useful" in my life:

> - Will I use it at least once a week?

I tried thinking about more, but this is enough for now. Some things definitely don't apply here. Like my investment account. I only use that once a month. But it is useful for sure. But I am just going to apply this to whatever I am trying to make now.

Which brings me to the actual idea. Something related to cooking. As part of a larger effort to save money, I started cooking at home much more. In 2023, when I first moved to Tokyo, I ate out quite a lot, maybe almost 3 days a week for lunch and dinner. That doesn't sound too bad. When I look at my monthly average spending on food in 2023, which included groceries, it was around 50,000 yen. That sounds fine, could be worse. But I started thinking that I could shave off like 1/3 of that and invest that or put that towards a nice vacation instead. The power of saving!

So yes, cooking at home = saving money. In 2024 I was somewhat on and off about it (wasn't very good at recording my expenses that year so I have no records to tell). But now that I have moved in 2025 and set up a pretty good living situation with my partner, we have been so consistent about cooking at home. We only eat out like once or twice a month together now. And the best part: I've been genuinely _enjoying_ cooking my own meals. There's a lot to like. For one, I can adjust the taste to my own preferences. Make everything spicy! Extra garlic! Second, I am able to get creative and cook new dishes. This is a big one. It makes cooking feel like an actual hobby (which I argue it should be respected as one, for those who are passionate about it). I'm able to spice things up and experiment. I've been watching a lot of cooking shows recently that inspire me and make me feel hungry. So I act on that and try something. Sometimes it's bad. I remember making komatsuna pasta once in an effort to make something similar to spinach pasta, but it was not good.

Anyways, the problem is that it's difficult to stay engaged consistently. Some weeks I am just not inspired and don't want to think too much about cooking. That's fine once in a while, but frequent and long lulls is something I want to avoid. Which is why I want to actually address this by building a tool that will keep me engaged. Keep me _hooked_ on cooking.

I have been deliberating between ideas like meal planning app but I want to keep it very focused. For just my use case. I have tried structured meal plans and also making meals in advance, but I quickly tire of the boredom and lack of creativity and variety. I want to feel like I have creative power over my meals. I want to learn how to cook new cuisines and use ingredients I have never tried using before. I want to be a better cook. At the same time, I don't want to break the bank too much and stay within a reasonable budget.

So I thought of this idea: what if I had a cute "personal chef" with boundless knowledge about cooking different foods, but this chef would be more of an assistant that helps me along my journey instead of deciding everything for me? This chef would introduce new ideas and help me keep things fresh, while also making sure we are within budget constraints and I can realistically cook the thing (I don't have an oven, for instance).

It's still a pretty abstract idea for now, but I can confidently say that if there was any service like that, I would use it very frequently. Definitely at least once a week.
