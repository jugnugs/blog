Recently, I have been trying out a new daily routine. Well, I don't know if I would call it a routine necessarily, but it is a lifestyle. It's not strictly structured, though I do try to plan in advance. It looks a little like this:

1. Wake up at 8am, eat breakfast, stretch a little
2. Work from 9am - 6pm
3. Exercise a bit (roughly 30 min)
4. Prepare and eat dinner
5. Do something
6. Do something
7. Probably shower
8. Plan what to do tomorrow
9. Do something, maybe reading
10. Go to bed at 12am

The only things that are fairly structured are the morning routine and work schedule. Everything else I have intentionally kept loose and flexible. I do this because I have somewhat of a resistance to completely blocked scheduling. I did it almost religiously for a year or two in college but at some point, I found it too stale, too rigid. I was doing the planning the same things and blocking out the same routine day in and day out. Maybe the scheduling method is not the blame, but my own lack of creativity. Nevertheless, it was also bad for my anxiety expecting I would be able to complete things within a certain time frame but missing the mark completely. I could have adjusted, I know. I think if it were me know, I wouldn't have been so stressed to get things done right away, but just in case I am easing into things now.

Anyway, the key thing here is to avoid from what you would call _dopaminergic activities_ at the beginning of the day. I have learned that dopamine is important for your motivation throughout the day, but you only have so much in daily reserves. Dopaminergic activies, or activities that cost very little dopamine to stay engaged with, are actually dopamine vampires. YouTube, TikTok, name your poison, they will suck the dopamine out of you dry. This leaves me, who just finished watching a 1-hour video analysis of a game I have never played before, feeling pretty drained. I don't have much dopamine left in my brain, so what do I do now?

_Another video in the suggestions bar here! Only costs a little dopamine to watch!_

Well golly! Perfect, came just at the right timing.

And so then ensues the spiral of consuming endlessly and endlessly, until the day is almost over and I wonder where all the time went.

I have been wanting to produce more in my free time. Consumption is easy, but rarely does it feel very fulfilling (unless I am actually learning something I find interesting). But to produce something, make something out of nothing, requires putting energy into it. That's the literal physics of it. Change is induced by putting some energy into it, or at least that's what I remember from high school science.

I can get started fine, I guess. I tell myself I should just get started, and the motivation will come naturally. But even after starting to draw or starting to write, I just get bored. My mind starts drifting in all directions. Can I just call this a day now? I want to go do something else. I'm not _engaged_.

I think that was the missing piece of the puzzle: figuring out a way to stay engaged in doing hard stuff. It's not because my brain is lazy and wants to sabotage my life--it's because it ran out of dopamine. I spent too much dopamine watching a random video before. (By the way, my vice is YouTube, if you couldn't tell. I tried to detox from it but it ended after a few weeks). Now my brain can only handle more videos to mindlessly consume.

So now I'm trying something new. I'm not detoxing or banning YouTube or other apps completely. I'm just saving it for later. Remember all of the "do something" blocks scheduled for later in the day? I might put something on to watch then. But since it's later in the day, I am more conscious of the fact that there are fewer hours left to spend. Would I rather spend it on something productive and I've been wanting to do, or would I rather spend it on another YouTube video that I won't remember the contents of in a few days time? Of course, there are exceptions; some videos are great and nugets of educational wisdom. I learned all of this stuff about dopamine in like, 3 YouTube videos.

The point is that I become way more intentional about what I do with my remaining time. I have the dopamine to do creative, hard things. There is a natural motivation to start something and continue it now.

There's something relieving knowing that motivation _can_ be controlled like this. I can't _what_ I desire or what my impulses are, but if I have enough dopamine, making the decision to _not_ give into sleeping in or _not_ watch another video becomes easier.

This might not be sustainable, I don't know. Maybe I will give this routine up next week. All I can say it's working pretty well so far. I finally picked up and I've been getting through the classic book _Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software_ again. I had accidentally bought the book in Japanese which reduced by reading speed by 60%. I felt like I wasn't getting much out of it for the time I was putting in slogging through, so I gave up. But now, I'm going through it. Yes, it's a turtleneck-pace, but I'm actually enjoying it a lot this time around. Probably helps that it's a great book.

That among other things. Working on my new app idea, studying for the JLPT, etc. Writing this blog post. Actually, I was pretty darn eager since a few days ago to write this, since I felt so excited to be able to do all of these things that I gave up on. Progress may be slow, yes, but what is "progress" anyways? Life is about enjoying things in the moment, right? The slower I take it, the more I can take in and enjoy. Surprisingly enough, I've been finding a lot of joy in taking things the slow way. I'm no longer in school anymore; there are no grades to maintain or deadlines to meet. I can learn things at my own pace. I finally remember now how much I truly do enjoy learning new things. That's whats making life pretty enjoyable now, and also why I'm able to wake up consistently at 8am.
