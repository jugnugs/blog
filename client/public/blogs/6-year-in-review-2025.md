The year 2025 is coming to an end. It was definitely an eventful year for the world and many of us, I'm sure. I usually don't do intentional yearly reflections like this, but for the sake of recording things down for the future, I want to start with this.

I looked back on what I did each month. Also at what happened _to me_. The distinction here is important, because in there lies an important insight.

A lot of what happened this year was out of my control. My grandmother passed away. Friends I thought would stay close by, at least for the near future, decided to move away and pursue their own goals. The low notes at work. All that combined with the chaos going on in the world around. But I am not focusing on that for my own sanity. The point is, these are all things that passively happened in my life.

I struggled to remember what had happened each month. I assumed and feared this was because most of my year was spent passively. That was my impression of it before starting the reflection. Things kind of just happened. And then they passed, and now this is the present. This isn't inherently bad; that's part of life right? But for whatever reason, the thought of this was disappointing. It made me feel uncomfortable in a strange way. It made me feel like I was a weak person, someone who could only be swept the tides of the surrounding waves. Maybe that's a bad analogy. The point is that it didn't match my expectations of what kind of person I should be.

There's a whole can of worms to get into when I say "what kind of person I _should_ be," regarding self-esteem. But that is off topic. This year, I thought a lot about how time is short for me, for everybody. The one resource we can never regenerate or bargain for. Alongside this, I thought about how I wanted to spend that time meaningfully. According to my values, my curiosities. **With intention**.

I figured that to do something with intention is to do something that you decided to do for a good reason. It's the opposite of passively experiencing something--it's actively going out of your way to do it. The control is in my grasp.

So how much of my year was actually **intentional**? To my surprise, I think most of it was. Blame my poor memory for not being able to recall that, but it was a nice feeling clearly seeing that I made intentional actions and decisions this year. Here are some:

- Set financial goals and a investment/savings plan. Diligently saved the portioned savings amount each month and invested it.
- Became more intentional with spending money, another important resource. Brought back the spreadsheets for monthly budgeting and expense tracking.
- Learning how to cook all kinds of delicious foods at home. I made bread for the first time and it was such a joy!
- Move in to a comfortable, spacious apartment with my partner.
- Homemaking and interior decorating until I felt satisfied. There is still a fair amount of work to be done, but just having a lot of houseplants for now has been enough.
- Published this blog.
- Re-evaluated my values and priorities in life. Took a lot of time to think and mull things over, as well as talk to others about it.
- Took and passed some exams (基本情報、日本語能力試験N1).
- Seriously started my journey learning Vietnamese as a late heritage speaker.
- Participated in some community events.
- Tried a new fitness plan.
- Finished some books.

Overall, I spent a good chunk of the year developing fundamental life skills and creating an environment where I felt I could thrive, that being a nice, peaceful apartment with a spacious kitchen and more control over its condition. While I loved living in a sharehouse for the year and a half-ish I was there, I definitely needed my own room to breathe. I feel much more at-home and myself now that I have established a nice base here. Though as much as an introvert I am, I do like connecting with other people a lot so I have made efforts to extend outside of home base to do that too. This among other things will be continued efforts into 2026. Another post in the vein of something like a New Year's resolution to come soon!
