## Introduction

I have never tried to publicize my thoughts in any way. Partially because I believe I don't have anything important to say that I need the world to pay attention to, but maybe even more so this: _I am afraid_. There's something scary about sharing a piece of yourself you would not normally share, especially to an unknown audience that is the Internet. What will people think if I say this? Maybe I have the wrong opinion about this to begin with, I need to be careful before I post anything. What can I do to convey this in the cleanest way possible to **_avoid conflict and confusion_**?

It's an impossible goal. I cannot predict who will see and read my words. I can't predict how they will feel and react to those words. No matter how much I can try to control the output, it will never please everyone. That's just how it works. So I write for myself, and maybe a small audience that can resonate, but I don't have high expectations that anyone can. Not because I think I am special, but I want to free myself from the concept of expectations to begin with: what I feel and write is what I feel and write, that's it. It's by being able to do this that I am able to get a grasp, if only a small sliver, of the individual that is me.
